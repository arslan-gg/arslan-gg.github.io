      <section>
        <p>
          Over the past 9 years, I've worked at major projects in fintech,
          healthcare, IoT, and energy sectors, consistently delivering
          high-impact solutions. My work has directly affected millions of users
          and processed billions of data points daily.
        </p>

        <p>
          In fintech, I architected a trading platform that grew to serve 30
          million users. Using <strong>Domain-Driven Design</strong> and
          <strong>Event-Driven Architecture</strong>, I helped a team that
          delivered this complex product in just six months. A key component was
          the fraud prevention system I developed, which now protects millions
          of dollars in daily transactions, reducing fraud by 2.3x within its
          first month of implementation.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the healthcare industry, I engineered a 3D medical scan processing
          system now used in over 2,000 US clinics. This solution transformed
          complex 3D data into mobile-friendly visualizations, reducing analysis
          time from hours to minutes. I achieved this by designing re-meshing
          pipelines using <strong>S3</strong>, <strong>Amazon SQS</strong>, and
          <strong>Lambda</strong>, significantly reducing processing costs.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the energy sector, I developed a core integration service for 3
          million smart meters, processing 96 million distribution network data
          parameters per hour. This system adheres to the IEC 61968 standard,
          enabling seamless integration of ADMS, MDM, HES, and Billing systems
          from different vendors. Additionally, I created a mathematical
          optimization tool for power transmission parameters, reducing
          decision-making time from 2 weeks to 1 day.
        </p>

        <p>
          My technical expertise spans multiple languages and technologies. I'm
          proficient in <strong>Go</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, and
          <strong>Kotlin</strong>, with working knowledge of
          <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and
          <strong>TypeScript</strong>. I've extensively worked with
          <strong>AWS</strong>, <strong>Docker</strong>,
          <strong>Kubernetes</strong>, <strong>Apache Kafka</strong>, and
          <strong>RabbitMQ</strong>. This diverse skill set allows me to choose
          the most effective tools for each project's unique requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've consistently improved development processes throughout my career.
          For instance, I refactored a test framework that halved boilerplate in
          integration tests and reduced pipeline time from 40 to 8 minutes. In
          another project, I implemented Domain-Driven Design practices that
          enabled a team to adopt new approaches and start development within 2
          weeks.
        </p>

        <p>
          My international experience includes work on high-profile projects, as
          well as participating in the ACM ICPC World Championship as part of my
          university team, showcasing my problem-solving skills at a global
          level.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hold an MSc degree from Technical University Ilmenau, Germany. I'm
          fluent in English and have limited working proficiency in German,
          enabling effective communication in diverse, international teams.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking ahead, I'm eager to take on new challenges that push the
          boundaries of what's possible in software engineering. If you're
          seeking an experienced architect who can deliver scalable, secure, and
          innovative solutions, let's connect and discuss how I can contribute
          to your next big project.
